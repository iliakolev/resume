# Resume

Hi, my name is Ilia and I'm currently full-stack developer at [Swimcloud](https://www.swimcloud.com/) 

## Experience

### Swimcloud (Sept 2015 - Present)

I joined [Swimcloud](https://www.swimcloud.com/) as a web developer, contributing to the 
development and design of scalable front-end architectures. Over time, I transitioned 
into a full-stack developer role, gaining valuable experience in both front-end and 
back-end technologies. In this capacity, I have played a key role in enhancing the user 
experience of our applications. As my responsibilities expanded, I also acquired skills

### Jinx Factory (Mar 2013 - July 2015)

As a web developer at Jinx Factory, I led the build of websites and played a pivotal role
